# Beacon Project — Professional Presence Audit & Revised Strategy

## Current State Assessment

### GitHub (@michaelpawlus)
**Profile:** 52 repos, 25 followers, no profile README

**What's visible:**
- 6 pinned repos — all R-based fundraising analytics
- `fundraising_analytics` (9 stars, 9 forks) — your most visible project
- `pg_donors` — planned giving predictive modeling in R
- `irs990lookup` — R package for IRS 990 data
- `lyric_match_app` — R app using GeniusR
- `young_alum_pred_mod` — R
- `giving_by_major_comparison` — HTML/R

**Existing GitHub Pages site (michaelpawlus.github.io):**
- Old Jekyll blog, "Fundraising Analytics" subtitle
- Posts about EPL away goals rule, Burnley margins, figure skating medal distribution, song lyric matching, giving vehicle analysis
- Mix of sports analytics + fundraising analytics, all in R
- No mention of Python, AI, LLMs, Databricks, or any current work

**Gap analysis:**
| What AI-first companies want to see | What's currently visible |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Python projects | All R |
| AI/LLM/agentic work | None |
| Data engineering (Databricks, SQL, pipelines) | None |
| Modern tooling (Claude Code, APIs, etc.) | None |
| Recent activity | Older projects |
| Profile README | Missing |

**Verdict:** Your GitHub currently tells the story of "R developer doing fundraising analytics at a university" — which was accurate years ago but completely undersells who you are now. An AI-first company reviewing this profile would not see the person who builds agentic workflows, implements Copilot Premium, develops AI agents for donor correspondence, and modernizes data warehouses to Databricks.

### LinkedIn
**Title:** Data Scientist at The Ohio State University

**What's visible:**
- Headline focused on R and fundraising analytics
- 7 years of R experience emphasized
- Deep learning/NLP mentioned but as secondary
- DRIVE 2017 conference presentations featured (excellent speaker reviews)
- Career trajectory visible: Habitat for Humanity → St. Francis College → Grand Valley State → Trust for Public Land → USC → Ohio State

**Strengths:**
- Speaking experience with strong audience feedback
- Non-traditional career path (English teacher → librarian → prospect research → data scientist) — this is a compelling narrative
- Cross-sector experience (nonprofit, higher ed, conservation)
- Director-level management experience (Trust for Public Land — led team of 3)

**Gaps:**
- No mention of AI implementation, agents, or modern AI tools
- Databricks work not visible
- Python not prominently featured
- Current role description likely doesn't reflect AI leadership work
- No content/posts about AI adoption or implementation
- Featured section likely doesn't showcase current capabilities

**Verdict:** LinkedIn tells a story that's 3-5 years behind where you actually are. The AI implementation work, Copilot Premium rollout, agent development, data warehouse modernization, and governance framework creation — none of that is visible. You're doing the work that AI-first companies want to hire for, but nobody can see it.

### Career Narrative — The Untold Story

Here's what's powerful about your background that isn't being told:

**The unconventional path:** Public Relations → Librarianship → Teaching English in Korea → Prospect Research → Data Science → AI Implementation. This is not a weakness — it's a differentiator. It shows adaptability, curiosity, and the ability to self-teach and evolve. AI-first companies like Shopify and Anthropic explicitly value people who learn and adapt over people with traditional credentials.

**The bridge-builder role:** You sit between technical AI implementation and organizational change management in a massive institution (Ohio State). You're not just building AI tools — you're getting a 50,000+ person institution to adopt them. That's harder than the technical work and extremely valuable.

**The practitioner credibility:** You don't just talk about AI — you're implementing Copilot Premium, building declarative agents, developing governance frameworks, and modernizing data infrastructure. You've done the messy, real-world work of making AI work in an organization that isn't a startup.

**The speaking/teaching background:** Conference presentations with outstanding reviews, teaching experience in multiple countries. AI-first companies need people who can evangelize and teach, not just implement.

## Revised Strategy: The 12-Month Brand Build

Given the 12-18 month runway, the strategy shifts from "find jobs fast" to "build a compounding professional presence that makes you a magnet for the right opportunities."

### Phase 0 (NEW) — Quick Wins (Week 1-2)

Before building the Beacon platform, do some immediate high-impact fixes:

**GitHub (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] Create a profile README (`michaelpawlus/michaelpawlus` repo)
  - Current title + focus: "Data Scientist building AI implementation infrastructure at Ohio State"
  - Highlight Python, Databricks, AI agents, LLM integration
  - Link to LinkedIn + future personal site
- [ ] Re-pin repos: unpin the R-only repos, pin Beacon once it exists
- [ ] Update bio: Remove "Fundraising Analytics" framing, add AI/data engineering focus
- [ ] Update profile links

**LinkedIn (1-2 hours):**
- [ ] Update headline: Something like "Data Scientist | AI Implementation & Strategy | Building the future of AI-augmented organizations"
- [ ] Update About section to reflect AI leadership work
- [ ] Update current role description to include AI agent development, Copilot Premium, Databricks modernization, governance frameworks
- [ ] Add key skills: Python, Databricks, LLMs, AI Strategy, Claude, Copilot

**GitHub Pages site:**
- [ ] Decision: Either take down the old Jekyll blog or keep it as-is and build new site separately
- [ ] Recommendation: Keep the old site (it shows you've been writing and coding for years) but build the new site on a fresh domain or subdomain

### Phase 1 — Beacon Company Intelligence Database (Weeks 2-4)
*(Same as previously planned, but now with the added context that this is your first "new era" public project)*

This becomes the first thing visible on your GitHub that says "I build with AI, I think strategically about AI adoption, and I ship functional software."

### Phase 1.5 (NEW) — Personal Website V1 (Weeks 4-6)

**Why move this up:** With a 12-month runway, the website becomes the hub that everything else feeds into. Get a minimal version up early, then iterate.

**Recommendation: Astro + GitHub Pages or Vercel**
- Astro is fast, Markdown-driven, deploys to Vercel free tier
- Start minimal: About, Projects (just Beacon initially), Blog (empty initially), Resume
- The site itself is a project — built with modern tooling

**Domain options:**
- `michaelpawlus.dev` or `mpawlus.dev` (~$12/year) — professional, developer-focused
- `michaelpawlus.com` (~$12/year) — broader, more traditional
- Keep `michaelpawlus.github.io` — free, but less professional
- Could use Vercel subdomain initially (`michaelpawlus.vercel.app`) — free

### Phase 2 — Content Engine (Months 2-4)

With the website up and Beacon built, start publishing. The long runway means you can build a body of work.

**Blog post ideas (each one is also a LinkedIn post):**
1. "I Built an AI-First Company Index — Here's What I Found" (Beacon report)
2. "What I Learned Rolling Out Copilot Premium to a University" (sanitized OSU experience)
3. "The Non-Traditional Path to Data Science (and Why AI Makes It Even More Accessible)"
4. "Building AI Agents for Non-Technical Users: Lessons from Higher Ed"
5. "From SQL Server to Databricks: A Data Warehouse Modernization Story"
6. "Why I Think Every Data Scientist Should Use Claude Code"
7. "Declarative Agents vs. Custom Code: When to Use What"
8. "The Age of the Builder: Why AI-First Companies Will Win"

**Cadence:** 1 post per month minimum, 2 per month ideal. Cross-post to LinkedIn. Each post generates a GitHub commit (companion code).

### Phase 3 — Job Scanner (Months 3-5)
*(As previously planned)*

### Phase 4 — Application Generator (Months 5-7)
*(As previously planned, but by now you have a rich knowledge base to draw from)*

### Phase 5 — Dry Runs (Months 6-12)

This is your unique idea and it's excellent. Periodically:
1. Find a job posting you genuinely like
2. Run the full pipeline: generate application materials
3. Analyze gaps: "What would make me a stronger candidate for THIS role?"
4. Create a targeted improvement plan
5. Build the missing portfolio piece or write the missing blog post
6. Do NOT apply (unless it's genuinely amazing) — just use it as a training signal

This creates a feedback loop: dry run → identify gap → fill gap → become stronger candidate → repeat.

### Phase 6 — Active Search Sprint (Months 12-18)

When the time is right:
- Beacon database is mature with 6+ months of job monitoring data
- Portfolio has 8-12 blog posts + multiple public projects
- LinkedIn shows consistent AI-focused activity for a year
- GitHub shows active Python/AI development
- Personal site is established with organic traffic
- Application generator has been refined through dry runs
- You're not "looking for a job" — you're "selectively evaluating opportunities at AI-first companies"

## The Compounding Effect

Here's why the long runway is your biggest advantage:

**Month 1:** Beacon repo + profile cleanup → 1 visible AI project
**Month 3:** Website + 2 blog posts → starting to look like an AI practitioner
**Month 6:** 5+ blog posts + Beacon scanner + dry runs → clear expertise signal
**Month 9:** 8+ posts + multiple projects + LinkedIn engagement → recognizable in AI-for-enterprise space
**Month 12:** Established presence, refined application system, clear narrative → ready to be selective
**Month 15:** Companies are coming to you, not the other way around

The person who starts applying at month 12 with this body of work is in a completely different position than someone who starts applying tomorrow with an R-heavy GitHub and an outdated LinkedIn.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **This conversation:** Finalize Phase 0 quick wins — I can draft your GitHub profile README and LinkedIn updates right now
2. **This week:** Start Beacon Phase 1 — schema, initial research, repo setup
3. **Decision needed:** Domain name preference for personal site
4. **Decision needed:** What can you share publicly from OSU work (even sanitized)?
