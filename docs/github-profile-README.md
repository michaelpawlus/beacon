# Hi, I'm Michael Pawlus

Data Scientist building AI implementation infrastructure at The Ohio State University. I work at the intersection of AI strategy, data engineering, and organizational change — helping a 50,000+ person institution adopt AI tools and agentic workflows at scale.

## What I'm working on

- **AI Agent Development** — Building agents for research summarization, donor correspondence, and report analysis using Claude and Microsoft 365 Copilot
- **Data Warehouse Modernization** — Migrating from on-premise SQL Server to Databricks, designing semantic layers and governance frameworks
- **AI Adoption Strategy** — Leading Copilot Premium implementation, developing governance frameworks, and building the case for AI-first operations in higher education
- **[Beacon](https://github.com/michaelpawlus/beacon)** — An AI-powered job search platform that curates AI-first companies and automates application workflows *(in progress)*

## What I write about

I'm interested in the practical side of AI implementation — not the theory, but what it actually takes to deploy AI solutions in large organizations. Topics I cover:

- Deploying AI agents to production for non-technical users
- Enterprise AI tool rollout strategy (what works, what doesn't)
- Data engineering patterns with Databricks
- The "Age of the Builder" — why AI-first companies will win

## Background

My path to data science was non-traditional: Public Relations → Librarianship → Teaching English in South Korea → Prospect Research → Data Science → AI Implementation. I've worked across nonprofits, conservation, and higher education, and I believe the best AI practitioners are people who understand both the technology and the humans who use it.

## Tech

**Day-to-day:** Python, SQL, Databricks, Claude API, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Git

**Data & ML:** pandas, scikit-learn, PySpark, NLP, propensity modeling, audience segmentation

**Infrastructure:** Databricks, SQL Server, BigQuery, Workfront (Agile)

**AI Tools:** Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Microsoft Copilot Studio
